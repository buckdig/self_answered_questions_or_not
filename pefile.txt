# wtf is pe file?

- portable executable file which is only available in windows; linux uses ELF "executable and linkable format"

# why should i learn this?

- shouldn't if u're not reverse engineer
- basic for re+forensics+contain lot of important fields (lot of other things i don't know)
- ex: if i have txt file, i couldn't do much; however, .exe or .bin is different2me

# okay, tell me the basic

- concepts: pe file on `disk` "non-executed-yet" || `memory` "already-executed"
- it's used by winLoader, load file into memory; however, winLoader only loaded the important "fields" first
=> so file on disk and memory is the same, but their structures.
- all memory loaded by code+data+resources+import_tables+export_tables+ other required module data structures is in one contiguous block of memory

# too general, more specific plz? about its structure?
